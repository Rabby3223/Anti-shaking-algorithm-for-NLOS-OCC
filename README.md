# Anti-shaking-algorithm-for-NLOS-OCC
## Description
The NLOS OCC system using reflected light exhibits its advantages, such as (i) reduced requirement on alignment and (ii) the expanded received rolling shutter pattern to achieve a larger data rate. However, there are few investigations and solutions to the effect of unconcise handshaking in the NLOS OCC system. This
